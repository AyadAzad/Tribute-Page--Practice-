# Tribute-Page--Practice-

This HTML project was a good and fun practice from FreeCodeCamp, I just tried to see more about FreeCodeCamp, but I think now I'm falling in love with the practices from
FreeCodeCamp.

NOTE: this is an old practice , but I want to post every practices and projects I have done or(will do in the future), so more projects are coming soon....

it will be a good practice for myself and people who see my profile.

This project is simple , so I think it's not necessary to explain everything here

2- the second part conatains a sectin tag, inside it we have a timeline heading and a bunch of timeline listes
